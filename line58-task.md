Support raw output mode (no formatting)

## Original Ticket Text

- [ ] Support raw output mode (no formatting)

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

Based on the task requirements and codebase context:

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Implement full support for raw output mode where no formatting (colors, styling, decorations) is applied to output
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Review existing formatter interface and console formatter implementation for raw mode handling
3. **Design Approach**: Ensure consistent raw mode behavior across all formatter methods and content types
4. **Risk Assessment**: Ensure backward compatibility and no breaking changes to existing formatting behavior
5. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive tests for raw mode across all formatter operations
6. **Performance Considerations**: Raw mode should be as fast or faster than formatted mode
7. **Security Considerations**: Raw mode should not expose any additional sensitive information
8. **Maintainability**: Clear contracts and interfaces for raw mode behavior

Key architectural considerations:

- Raw mode is an infrastructure concern (formatter responsibility)
- Core domain should remain unaware of formatting details
- Must work consistently across all content types (content, errors, progress, streaming)
- Should potentially disable progress indicators in raw mode
- Need to consider CLI integration for user control over raw mode
- Must maintain hexagonal architecture principles
