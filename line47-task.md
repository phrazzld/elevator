## Original Ticket Text

"Implement Google Generative AI client adapter"

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

Analyze the implementation approach for creating a Gemini API client adapter that:

1. Implements the GeminiAPIClient interface defined in src/core/apiClient.ts
2. Uses the Google Generative AI SDK (@google/generative-ai)
3. Maps between our domain types and SDK types
4. Handles both streaming and non-streaming content generation
5. Provides proper error mapping from SDK errors to domain APIError types
6. Follows hexagonal architecture principles (adapter pattern)
7. Is fully testable with mocked external dependencies

Consider:

- How to initialize and configure the Google SDK
- Error handling and mapping strategies
- Streaming implementation details
- Configuration management (API key, model settings)
- Testing approach with mocked SDK
- Type safety throughout the implementation
