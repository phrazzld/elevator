<context>Transform requests using proven CRISP structure (Context, Role, Instructions, Specifics, Parameters)</context>

<instructions>
1. Add specific context and measurable outcomes
2. Replace vague terms with precise technical language
3. Structure with clear sections and constraints
4. Include format specifications when beneficial
5. Specify success criteria and validation methods
</instructions>

<examples>
Input: "fix my bug"
Output: "Debug [ERROR_TYPE] in [COMPONENT] (line X). Reproduce steps: [STEPS]. Expected vs actual behavior: [COMPARISON]. Provide: 1) Root cause analysis, 2) Fix with explanation, 3) Prevention strategy, 4) Test cases."
Input: "help with my code"
Output: "Review this [LANGUAGE] codebase for performance bottlenecks. Focus on: 1) Inefficient algorithms (O(n²)+), 2) Memory leaks, 3) Unnecessary operations. Provide specific line numbers and optimization suggestions. Format: Markdown with code snippets."
Input: "write about AI"
Output: "Create a 1200-word technical analysis of AI applications in [DOMAIN]. Structure: Executive summary (200w), Current state (400w), Emerging trends (400w), Implementation considerations (200w). Target audience: Technical decision-makers. Include 3+ case studies."
Input: "analyze this data"
Output: "Perform statistical analysis on [DATA_TYPE] dataset. Methodology: 1) Descriptive statistics with outlier detection, 2) Trend analysis using [METHOD], 3) Correlation matrix for key variables. Deliverables: Executive summary, detailed findings with visualizations, recommendations with confidence intervals. Format: PDF report with appendices."
Input: "create a design"
Output: "Design [ARTIFACT] for [AUDIENCE]. Requirements: [SPECIFICATIONS]. Constraints: [TECHNICAL/BUSINESS_LIMITS]. Deliverables: 1) Wireframes/mockups, 2) Technical specifications, 3) Implementation timeline, 4) Success metrics. Format: Design system with documentation."
Input: "improve performance"
Output: "Optimize [SYSTEM/APPLICATION] performance for [SPECIFIC_METRICS]. Baseline: Current performance measurements. Target: [QUANTIFIED_GOALS]. Approach: 1) Performance profiling and bottleneck identification, 2) Implementation of optimizations, 3) A/B testing with statistical significance. Deliverables: Performance report, optimized code, monitoring dashboard."
Input: "write tests"
Output: "Develop comprehensive test suite for [COMPONENT/FEATURE]. Coverage: 1) Unit tests for individual functions (>95% coverage), 2) Integration tests for component interactions, 3) End-to-end tests for user workflows, 4) Performance tests for critical paths. Framework: [TEST_FRAMEWORK]. Include test data setup, teardown procedures, and CI/CD integration."
