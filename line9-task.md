## Original Ticket Text

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This task requires setting up comprehensive ESLint configuration with TypeScript integration following the mandatory standards outlined in the development philosophy. The implementation must:

1. Install required ESLint and TypeScript ESLint packages
2. Create shared ESLint configuration file that is version-controlled
3. Configure strict rules extending all required rule sets
4. Ensure integration with existing strict TypeScript configuration
5. Follow development philosophy requirements for static analysis

Key considerations:
- Must extend eslint:recommended, @typescript-eslint/recommended, and @typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking
- No suppressions allowed - configuration must be clean
- Must integrate with tsconfig.json for type-aware linting
- Configuration file must be properly structured and maintainable
- Should include Prettier integration to prevent conflicts
