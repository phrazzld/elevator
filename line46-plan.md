# Implementation Plan: Gemini API Interface

## Overview

Create a Gemini API interface defined by the core domain following hexagonal architecture principles.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Interface Design

- Define interface in core domain (not in adapters)
- Follow dependency inversion principle
- Support enhanced prompts as input
- Return structured responses with error handling
- Include configuration options (model, temperature, etc.)

### 2. Core Contracts

- Input: EnhancedPrompt + API options
- Output: Result<APIResponse, APIError>
- Support both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Include timeout and cancellation support
- Define clear error types for different failure modes

### 3. Location

Place interface in `src/core/` to ensure it's defined by the core domain, not the infrastructure layer.

### 4. Error Handling

- Map to domain error types
- Support network errors, rate limiting, safety blocks
- Include retry-able vs non-retry-able error classification

## Success Criteria

- Interface defined in core domain
- Follows dependency inversion principle
- Supports all required operations
- Clear type definitions
- No external SDK dependencies in interface
- Follows existing code patterns
