# Performance Baseline Documentation

## Overview

This document records the performance baseline for the enhanced CRISP-based prompt transformation system implemented in Phase 1. The measurements track against the goal of <20ms transformation overhead.

## Baseline Measurements

**Date:** 2025-06-11T02:52:26.945Z  
**Environment:** Node.js v22.15.0, darwin arm64  
**Test Framework:** Vitest with 1000 iterations per measurement

### Results Summary

| Prompt Size | Length (chars) | Average Time (ms) | Performance vs Goal |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Short       | 7              | 0.005             | ✅ 400x faster      |
| Medium      | 96             | 0.005             | ✅ 4000x faster     |
| Long        | 683            | 0.006             | ✅ 3333x faster     |
| Extra Long  | 5078           | 0.015             | ✅ 1333x faster     |

**Overall Average:** 0.008ms (Goal: <20ms)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Scaling:** Performance scales linearly with input size
- **Throughput:** Processes 100,000+ characters per second
- **Consistency:** Low variance across multiple runs (CV < 50%)
- **Edge Cases:** Handles empty prompts and special characters efficiently

### What is Measured

The benchmark isolates the prompt transformation logic excluding API calls:

1. **Request Construction:** Building the structured request object with `ELEVATION_PROMPT` and user input
2. **JSON Serialization:** Converting the request object to JSON string
3. **String Processing:** Length calculations and basic operations

### Test Implementation

Location: `src/api.benchmark.test.ts`

The benchmark suite includes:

- **Baseline measurements** for different prompt sizes
- **Performance scaling analysis** with detailed metrics
- **Consistency verification** across multiple runs
- **Edge case testing** for empty and special character inputs
- **Regression detection** with structured baseline documentation

### Performance Goals Status

✅ **ACHIEVED:** All measurements are significantly under the 20ms goal  
✅ **MARGIN:** Average performance is 2500x faster than the target  
✅ **SCALABILITY:** Even extra-long prompts (5000+ chars) complete in <20ms  
✅ **CONSISTENCY:** Performance remains stable across different input types

### Regression Monitoring

Run the benchmark tests to check for performance regressions:

```bash
pnpm test src/api.benchmark.test.ts
```

The tests will fail if performance degrades beyond acceptable thresholds, alerting developers to investigate optimization opportunities.

### Future Considerations

- **Phase 2 Impact:** Monitor how modular pipeline affects performance
- **Memory Usage:** Consider memory profiling for very large prompts
- **Concurrency:** Test performance under concurrent load scenarios
- **Production Monitoring:** Add runtime performance tracking
